# Loan Prediction Project in Google Colab

This repository contains code and data for a loan prediction project implemented in Google Colab. The project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various features.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to build machine learning models to automate the loan approval process. By analyzing historical data, we predict whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected based on various applicant attributes and loan features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

- `Loan_ID`: Unique identifier for each loan application.
- `Gender`: Gender of the applicant (e.g., Male, Female).
- `Married`: Marital status of the applicant (e.g., Married, Unmarried).
- `Dependents`: Number of dependents.
- `Education`: Education level of the applicant (e.g., Graduate, Not Graduate).
- `Self_Employed`: Self-employment status (e.g., Yes, No).
- `ApplicantIncome`: Income of the applicant.
- `CoapplicantIncome`: Income of the coapplicant (if any).
- `LoanAmount`: Loan amount requested.
- `Loan_Amount_Term`: Term of the loan (e.g., 360 months).
- `Credit_History`: Credit history of the applicant (e.g., 1.0, 0.0).
- `Property_Area`: Property location (e.g., Urban, Rural).
- `Loan_Status`: Loan approval status (e.g., Y for Yes, N for No).

## Getting Started in Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. Click on "File" > "New Notebook" to create a new Colab notebook.

3. In the notebook, you can load and preprocess the dataset, train machine learning models, and make predictions. Refer to the provided notebook file (`Loan_Prediction.ipynb`) in this repository for the code and detailed instructions.

## Results

- The project results, including model performance metrics and insights, can be found in the .ipynb notebook that I provided.
